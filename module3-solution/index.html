    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" ><div class="box"><h2 id="nuggets" class="text-center">Nuggets</h2><p>The chicken nugget was invented in the 1950s by Robert C. Baker,
      a food science professor at Cornell University, and published as unpatented academic work.[2] This bite sized piece of chicken, coated 
      in batter and then deep fried was called the "Chicken Crispie" by Baker and his associates. Baker's innovations made it possible to form
       chicken nuggets in any shape. Common problems the meat industry were facing at the time of this invention were being
        able to hold ground meat together without a skin and producing a batter that could handle being both deep fried and
         frozen without coming off of the desired meat. Baker was able to solve both problems by first coating the meat in vinegar,
          salt, grains, and milk powder to make it hold together and secondly using an egg and grain based batter that was able to be fried as well as frozen.[3]</p><br><a href="#top">Back</a></div></div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" ><div class="box"><h2 id="sushi" name="sushi" class="text-center">Sushi</h2><p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

      Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
      It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
       of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled 
       daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
      
      Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, 
      or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2]</p><br><a href="#top">Back</a></div></div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><div class="box"><h2 id="beef" class="text-center">Beef</h2><p>A steak (/ˈsteɪk/) is a meat generally sliced across 
      the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. Exceptions, in which the meat is sliced parallel to the fibers, 
      include the skirt steak cut from the plate, the flank steak cut from the abdominal muscles, and the silverfinger 
      steak cut from the loin and including three rib bones. In a larger sense, fish steaks, ground meat steaks,
       pork steak, and many more varieties of steak are known.

      Steak is usually grilled, but can be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of
       steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.[1] Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and 
       kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.
      
      Steaks are often cut from grazing animals, usually farmed, other than cattle, including bison, camel, goat, horse, 
      kangaroo,[2][3] sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer, and zebu, as well as various types of fish,
      especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish, shark, and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, 
      lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, these cuts are often referred to as chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.
      
      Grilled portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak, and similarly for other vegetarian dishes.[4] 
      Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat. Grilled fruits such
       as watermelon have been used as vegetarian steak alternatives.</p><br><a href="#top">Back</a></div></div>
